# Matt's Notes
Hello there! If you somehow found your way here, and you're interested in poking around, a couple of locations are particularly handy:

## [User folder](users/warpotato) 

This folder contains a bunch of generic functionality I've abstracted away from individual keyboard layouts.

Most of them are utility functions for tapdance functionality, e.g. for implementing keyboard shortcuts. [See here for those.](users/warpotato/dances.h)

There is also an implementation of [super alt-tab](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_macros?id=super-alt%e2%86%aftab),
a single-tap alt-tab functionality I used to learn the details of QMK, including OS detection and reactivity, as well as timeout interactions in the QMK 
context. [Check that out here.](https://github.com/mdegreg/qmk_firmware/blob/master/users/warpotato/alttab.h)

This is a keyboard firmware based on the [tmk\_keyboard firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) with some useful features for Atmel AVR and ARM controllers, and more specifically, the [OLKB product line](https://olkb.com), the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com) keyboard, and the Clueboard product line.
